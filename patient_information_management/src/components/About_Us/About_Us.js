          <p>The Patient Information Management System, also known as PIMS, will allow for doctors, nurses, office staff,
             and volunteers to access different levels of patient data based on their job. Doctors can access all patient
             information and write additional notes on each patient. Nurses can access the same information but can only
             view the doctors' notes. Office staff will be able to access and update information about patients such as 
             name, address, and insurance information. Volunteers will be able to help office staff.
